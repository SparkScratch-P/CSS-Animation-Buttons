## How to Use 

 Like any of the buttons? Want to use it on your page? It's now made easy with the **Animated Buttons Generator**!
 
### Manual Method :
 
  - Your can go to the directory and search for index.html, and corresponding style.css files. It is well organised with comments there, so u can get your code, and use thm directly.

### Using the Animated Buttons Generator:

- Load the animated buttons Generator
- Choose a template from the library, and put the number there.
- Enter basic functionalities of the button with HTML.
- Give the basic parameters for CSS (No code required, just know what you are putting). If u cant figure out, put the values as per the template, as will be given along with the question in brackets.
- Then, it will import the animation from the template. So, basically, u have designed your own shape and size for badg, but taking the animations from the template.
- The Code lists are editable. So, if you want, you can also edit your code there.
- After it is done, copy the final code and paste in files. The HTML code is to be saved as `index.html` and the CSS as `style.css`. You can paste thm directly as Git Repos, or use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for offline purposes.

★ The Best part is that **You don't have to code a single line! It will ask you questions, and keep answering**. It will accordingly write your ***HTML*** and ***CSS*** code.

⚠️ Please don't edit, or attemp rename inline or file wise, until you are sure about the consequences!
