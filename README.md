## How to Use 

 Like any of the buttons? Want to use it on your page? It's now made easy with the **Animated Buttons Generator**!
 
### Manual Method :
 
  - Your can go to the directory and search for index.html, and corresponding style.css files. It is well organised with comments there, so u can get your code, and use thm directly.

### Using the Animated Buttons Generator:

- Load the animated buttons Generator
- Choose a template from the library, and put the number there.
- Enter basic functionalities of the button with HTML.
- Give the basic parameters for CSS (No code required, just know what you are putting). If u cant figure out, put the values as per the template, as will be given along with the question in brackets.
- Then, it will import the animation from the template. So, basically, u have designed your own shape and size for badg, but taking the animations from the template.
- The Code lists are editable. So, if you want, you can also edit your code there.
- After it is done, copy the final code and paste in files. The HTML code is to be saved as `index.html` and the CSS as `style.css`. You can paste thm directly as Git Repos, or use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for offline purposes.

★ The Best part is that **You don't have to code a single line! It will ask you questions, and keep answering**. It will accordingly write your ***HTML*** and ***CSS*** code.

⚠️ Please don't edit, or attemp rename inline or file wise, until you are sure about the consequences!

### Have made your own animation badge? Add it here!

Firstly, if u have made one, fork this repo, and edit, and create a PR. I will be very glad to accept! 

 Now, your button needs to be added to the batch maker. 
 
- Go to the[source code directory](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/CSS-Animation-Buttons/tree/main/source%20code) and download the `.sb3` file.
-  Add your CSS code to the list. Remember to add it line-wise. You should add thm to the list `Cascae Style Sheets`. 
-  Now, add compatible HTML line in the list , `template button HTML attribute index`.
-  Export with Turbowarp packager, keeping all parameters and activities same! Also upload your new scratch file to the source code folder, with the name, `css.sb3`.

The best method to add items line wise in a Scratch list is, save the textx, line wise, i mean, copy-paste from your code, and same as `.txt`. Then right click to target list, and import!
 
 There is a ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%8C%8CGlitch%20Here!-PRs%20Welcome!-red.svg?style=for-the-badge) batch up on this page. There's a glitch. Will wait for responses on it!
